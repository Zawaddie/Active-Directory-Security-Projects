## Overview & Purpose
This document gives you a **structured set of lab exercises** to practice both offensive techniques and defensive detections in an Active Directory environment. Each exercise includes objectives, prerequisites, safe commands to prepare the environment, and high-level steps to perform and defend against the technique. Do **not** perform these attacks outside environments you own or are authorized to test.

## Prerequisites
- AWS lab up with: `DC01` (Domain Controller), `WS01` and `WS02` (domain-joined workstations), `KALI01` (attacker). See `README.md`.
- Administrative access to DC or ability to create domain users and groups.
- Tools (install on Kali / Windows as needed): `impacket`, `crackmapexec`, `bloodhound/SharpHound`, `Responder`, `hashcat` (for offline cracking), `PowerView` (PowerShell AD enumeration), `Mimikatz` (use with caution), `Rubeus` (Kerberos), `ldapsearch/ldap3`.
- Snapshots / AMIs of DC and workstations created before tests.
